    <strong>Baby & Me (ages 0-2.5)</strong> <br>
    Baby & Me classes are a fun way for care givers and their babies or
    young toddlers to connect with each other in a playful environment
    with other care givers and their babies. Moms get to shake up daily
    baby routines and interact with other care givers and their babies.
    They also get a chance to get some exercise, and experience first time
    interactions with other little ones. These classes are a fun learning
    environment for both care giver and child. Classes not only stimulate
    the learning process in the child, but nurture the existing bond between
    care giver and child in a way that allows the care giver to break away from the stresses of parenthood, while learning how to simultaneously play and grow with your child. Students may graduate to Twinkle Babies (dance) and/or Cheer/Acro Tumble after Baby & Me as soon as they are ready to separate and begin on their own and reach the required age for entry.

    <br>
    <strong>Twinkle Babies (ages 2.5-3)</strong> <br>
    A thirty minute introductory dance class containing
    ballet, tap and creative movement. Young dancers
    will learn the basic steps while learning how to
    follow direction and imitate movement in a positive
    environment. Engaging music is used to get these
    little guys inspired to dance. The use of props such as Twinkle bears and hula hoops, enables the young dancers to use their imagination, creativity and, most of all, have fun!
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Twinkle Stars (ages 3-4, 4-5, 5-6)</strong> <br>
    An age specific 45 minute class containing ballet, tap and jazz/creative
    movement. The purpose of the class is to introduce young dancers to
    the three styles of dance and inspire movement and creativity within a
    positive environment. Dancers will also learn basic steps and
    terminology in all three styles. For example, all dancers will learn what
    a “plie” is and how to demonstrate one. The use of fun, age appropriate
    music engages the young dancers’ minds and bodies. The use of props
    such as hula hoops for the “freeze dance” makes the end of class the most fun! For Twinkle Stars 3 & 4, students must be 3.5 years old by August 1st (unless previously a Twinkle Baby).
